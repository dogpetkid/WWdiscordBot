# Intro to git

Firstly, [this](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is a useful thing to look at, but I will explain it here. 

What you first need to do is download gitbash from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Choose Windows and then download.

Next install this and then open it.

After you open it, you should be shown a user and directory. From here do `cd ~/Documents` to move to your documents and then `mkdir ./github; cd ./github` to make a github folder and move into it. After this you should make a folder dedicated to this project. To do this, do `mkdir ./WWdiscordBot` or name it whatever you want, just make sure you remember if you named it differently (from here on I will refer to the project folder as `WWdiscordBot`).
After this step is complete you should be able to open you file explore, go to your Documents/github and then see a folder called WWdiscordBot. (If you don't see this, **DON'T continue**, go back and redo those steps.)

Now, back inside of your `WWdiscordBot` (if you need to go back to this folder, do `cd ~/Documents/github/WWdiscordBot`), you will do `git init` which will set up your local repository.
